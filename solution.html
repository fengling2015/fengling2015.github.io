      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Saibai Island faces increasing environmental stress caused by flooding, soil salinity, and climate change. Local food supply is limited, and most fresh produce must be transported from the mainland, which is costly and often delayed. Therefore, there are explored three possible design options to create a sustainable and climate-resilient food system for the community.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Optional items</h2>
      <ul class="page-list">
        <li><strong>Option 1_Traditional Raised-Bed Farming: </strong>This option involved building raised soil beds using compost, coconut husk, and sand mixtures to create planting plots above flood level. Crops such as sweet potato, cassava, taro, and Warrigal Greens could be grown. Small drainage ditches would direct excess rainwater away during wet seasons, while hand watering or small tanks would be used in the dry season.However, this system requires continuous soil maintenance, manual irrigation, and fertilizer replenishment to retain productivity. On Saibai Island, freshwater availability is low, and bringing in soil or compost would involve high freight costs. The method also provides limited protection against salinity, as saltwater intrusion could still damage crops after storms.</li>
        <li><strong>Option 2_Hydroponic Greenhouse System: </strong>The second option proposed building a fully enclosed greenhouse with nutrient-film-technique (NFT) hydroponic trays and a controlled climate system powered by electricity. Vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes could grow rapidly with minimal pests. Sensors would regulate temperature, humidity, and nutrient flow, allowing consistent year-round production.Although technologically advanced, this solution depends on imported nutrient solutions, constant power supply, and expensive materials such as polycarbonate panels and aluminium frames. Establishing and maintaining the system would exceed the community’s current energy and funding capacity. Frequent shipping of nutrients and spare parts also increases long-term costs and vulnerability to supply disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Option 3_Aquaponics System: </strong>The third option combines aquaculture and hydroponics into an aquaponics system, where fish waste provides nutrients for plants, and plants purify the water for fish. The system uses solar-powered pumps, rainwater collection, and bio-secure tanks, allowing year-round production of barramundi fish and salt-tolerant vegetables.This design is environmentally sustainable, requires less maintenance water, and aligns with Saibai’s strong solar resources. It also creates training and employment opportunities for local residents, supporting community self-sufficiency and long-term climate resilience.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final Decision and Rationale</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After comparing the three options, our team chose the aquaponics system as the most suitable solution for Saibai Island. It effectively balances environmental sustainability, economic feasibility, and community empowerment. Unlike the traditional or hydroponic systems, aquaponics recycles water, reduces freight dependence, and fits the island’s cultural and environmental context.</li>
