    <h2>Context — why this matters</h2>
    <p>
      Saibai is an extremely low-lying alluvial island dominated by mangroves and salt marshes.
      King tides, storm surge and a short, intense wet season make local cultivation difficult,
      while long dry months tighten freshwater supply (Engineers Without Borders Australia, 2025;
      eAtlas, 2016/2024). Sea level in the Torres Strait has risen by roughly ~6 mm/year,
      increasing nuisance flooding and saltwater intrusion (Torres Strait Regional Authority, 2011).
      Most fresh food travels long distances within narrow tidal windows, so weather delays quickly
      become higher prices and empty shelves—an issue widely documented in remote Indigenous
      communities (Torres Cape Indigenous Council Alliance, 2023; CHOICE, 2024; House of
      Representatives Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs, 2020). In response, the Torres
      Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) and community partners are seeking a reliable,
      affordable, locally operated year-round food option with simple operations and clear
      accountability (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a).

  <section id="ewb">
    <h2>EWB Design Area & Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
      We selected the EWB Challenge theme “Climate change adaptation - Local food & livelihoods.”
      The brief calls for climate-responsive, culturally appropriate production that fits Saibai's
      environmental limits and isolated utilities—rainwater-first, low-energy, biosecure, and
      locally operated (Engineers Without Borders Australia, 2025).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="needs">
    <h2>Needs statement</h2>
    <p>Design and implement a community-run, rainwater-first, closed-loop food system that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>provides a stable weekly supply at predictable, affordable prices;</li>
      <li>operates with low water and energy intensity;</li>
      <li>recovers quickly from extreme weather or short power outages;</li>
      <li>secures community acceptance; and</li>
      <li>can be replicated as modular precincts (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a, 2025b).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="stakeholders">
    <h2>Stakeholders & responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TSIRC (client/owner): approvals, utilities integration, budget/milestone management, quarterly data review (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a).</li>
      <li>Saibai Mura Buway (RNTBC) / Elders: site consent, cultural protocols, youth mentorship, co-governance (Queensland Government, n.d.; Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2016).</li>
      <li>Community operations group & schools: daily operations, distribution, training, data logging (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2016).</li>
      <li>IBIS & local businesses: cold-chain links and seasonal buffering during freight disruptions (Torres Cape Indigenous Council Alliance, 2023).</li>
      <li>TSRA & partners (UTS/EWB/KFC): funding/technical support, prototyping, capacity building, and handover of SOPs, dashboards and training materials (Torres Strait Regional Authority, 2016; KFC Project Team, 2025).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="scope">
    <h2>Scope & boundaries</h2>
    <p>
      In scope: site selection outside storm-tide influence; modular aquaponics + raised
      beds; rainwater/recirculation treatment; staged PV/battery option; O&amp;M manuals and training;
      logistics and cost modelling; data dashboards and ledgers (Torres Strait Island Regional Council,
      2024, 2025b).
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of scope: island-wide seawalls or grid upgrades; cross-island wholesale
      distribution; large civil works beyond the precinct. Biosecurity enforcement and market
      regulation stay with the competent authorities; the project supplies compliance records and
      inputs (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2025).
    </p>

  <section id="success-criteria">
    <h2>Success criteria (what success looks like)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>By mid-2028, commission a 100 m * 100 m pilot precinct that provides a weekly share for
          ≥30% of households with a steady harvest cadence and prices trending below comparable
          store produce (CHOICE, 2024).</li>
      <li>Operated by a local team of ≥15 trained members able to handle routine checks, basic maintenance and drills independently (Engineers Without Borders Australia, 2025).</li>
      <li>Keeps irrigation ≥70% supplied by roof-water and treated recirculation, maintaining continuity
          through the dry season (Bureau of Meteorology, 2025; Time and Date, n.d.).</li>
      <li>Publishes four KPIs from day one—weekly yield (kg), water intensity (L/kg),
          energy intensity (kWh/kg), and household savings/adoption—aggregated weekly/monthly and
          reported quarterly to support transparent review and scale-up decisions (Torres Strait Island
          Regional Council, 2025a).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="constraints">
    <h2>Constraints & assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy: isolated diesel network → prioritise low-power, scheduled pumping; add small PV + battery once base load is verified; critical loads must ride through short outages (Ergon Energy, n.d.; Australian Energy Regulator, 2025).</li>
      <li>Water: wet-season capture sized to bridge 5-6 months of dry season; recycled water meets quality/biosecurity standards (Bureau of Meteorology, 2025; Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2023).</li>
      <li>Logistics: weather can delay barges/flights → standardise parts, keep on-site spares and set clear re-order points (Torres Cape Indigenous Council Alliance, 2023).</li>
      <li>Workforce: community-led operations with bilingual, highly visual training and quarterly drills (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2016).</li>
      <li>Compliance: only permitted seed/seedlings/fingerlings enter; entries logged; anomalies addressed within 24 hours (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2025).</li>
    </ul>
