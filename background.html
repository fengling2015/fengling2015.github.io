      <h2>Basic Information</h2>
      <p>Saibai Island is situated four kilometres south of Papua New Guinea and around 150 kilometres north of mainland Australia. The alluvial island spans 108 square kilometres and rises to only 1.7 metres at its highest point, with mangroves, grasslands, and salt marshes dominating the landscape(EWB Challenge 2025). These geomorphic and ecological features give Saibai a distinctive low-lying character: wide intertidal flats, vegetation adapted to saline conditions, and landforms that are both productive and vulnerable. The dominance of mangroves and salt marshes indicates important coastal processes and habitats. Around 338 residents live on the island in 2021.</p>
      <p>Contemporary supply chains are fragile. Barges and aircraft face long distances, narrow tidal windows, and diesel costs that inflate shelf prices, while storms frequently delay deliveries. For residents, this means access to everyday essentials—fresh produce, fuel, building materials, and health-related supplies—can be unpredictable and expensive. Stores can charge more than double metropolitan prices for staples, pushing households toward food insecurity and underscoring the need for dependable local production. The local food system should be strengthen. Strengthening local systems is  a fundamental strategy to reduce food supplying vulnerability, stabilize costs, and improve health and wellbeing. Local production becomes a platform for autonomy and resilience, enabling the community to buffer external shocks while aligning food choices with cultural preferences.</p>

      <h2>Risk Profile</h2>
      <div class="figure-placeholder">
        Planned: overlay the Zenadth Kes Coastal Hazard Adaptation Strategy flood extent map to visualise king tide exposure zones (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024).

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sea-level rise:</strong> Saibai is facing the threat of continuous sea level rise. Tide gauges show an average increase of approximately 6 mm per year between 1993 and 2010—twice the global(TSRA, 2011). The implication for such a flat island is profound: even small increments in mean sea level translate into markedly higher frequency of nuisance flooding and larger extents of saltwater intrusion. Locals have made it clear in interviews with news media that rising sea water has begun to limit their range of activities, and the land that was once a place for locals to gather and have fun is now covered by seawater(Wellauer & Ruddick, 2024). This gradual loss of accessible public space affects recreation, ceremony, and everyday mobility, narrowing safe windows for travel and community events and placing additional stress on infrastructure intended to keep the sea out of community.</li>
        <li><strong>Storm surge and king tides:</strong> The Torres Strait is narrow and the sea level difference between the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Indian Ocean to the west is huge, resulting in turbulent currents in the strait. Saibai Island is therefore exposed to a series of floods and king tides. The tides often over the previously built levees, which causing seawater to flow into the community, threatening the lives and property of the islanders, and even eventually causing the old levees to break(Wellauer & Ruddick, 2024). Even with the construction of new levees, these natural hazards continue to threaten local communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rainfall extremes:</strong> Despite its tropical location, Saibai Island has abundant annual precipitation, but this is a misunderstanding. In fact, Saibai Island does have abundant precipitation, but it is often concentrated only in the rainy season, which is less than half a year. During the rainy season, precipitation accounts for 95% of the year(EWB Challenge 2025). Precipitation is scarce during the rest of the dry season, only about 5% of the annual precipitation. Such pronounced seasonality complicates water security and agriculture. Short intense bursts stress drainage and exacerbate flooding, while extended dry spells heighten water storage demands and increase irrigation requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil salinity:</strong> Floods and tides can flood the land, and when the seawater evaporates, the salt will remain in the soil, causing soil salinity to rise(Huusko, 2015). In the long run, saline-alkali land will be formed. Although Saibai Island receives abundant rainfall, rainwater washes away salts from the soil, but uneven rainfall can prevent these salts from being washed away in time. The result is a patchwork of soils where productivity and crop choice are constrained. Selecting salt-tolerant species, elevating beds, and managing drainage become essential tactics. Over time, without careful management, salinization can reduce yields, limit species diversity in gardens, and undermine confidence in local food production.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport pressure:</strong> Saibai Island's remote location away from all major cities makes it expensive and time-consuming to obtain supplies, resulting in a high cost of living for local residents(AIATSIS, 2016).</li>
        <li><strong>Unenough current garden: </strong> Saibai Island has a garden called Mekem Garden. However, it has entered into decline in recent years (EWB Challenge 2025).</li>

      <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local islanders:</strong> Local residents need a more stable, affordable, and convenient food system that can operate reliably and sustainably to ensure their food supply.</li>
        <li><strong>Local government:</strong>Local governments have an obligation to help local residents improve their living conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineers Without Borders:</strong>By helping local residents, Engineers Without Borders can embody the EWB philosophy: using engineering to solve problems, focusing on sustainable development, promoting social equity, and building collaborative communities.</li>
