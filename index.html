      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The KFC team is collaborating with Engineers Without Borders Australia and the Saibai Island community to co-design a climate-resilient food system anchored by elevated growing beds, aquaponics, and solar-powered water management. The concept aims to stabilise fresh food access, reduce freight dependence, and protect cultural food practices while complying with Torres Strait Island Regional Council planning and biosecurity requirements (Engineers Without Borders Australia, 2025; KFC Project Team, 2025; Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024).</p>
      <p>Our approach responds to the island’s low elevation, recurrent inundation, and saltwater intrusion that continue to erode livelihoods, push up food prices, and threaten community health. Adapting food production to Saibai’s monsoonal climate, fragile soils, and remote logistics is central to safeguarding households’ wellbeing and sustaining their connection to Country (Green & Warusam, 2010; Queensland Government, n.d.; Torres Strait Regional Authority, 2011).</p>

      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Saibai covers 108 km² with settlements averaging 1 m above sea level; the island hosts approximately 338–500 residents with deep cultural ties to land and sea (eAtlas, 2016/2024; Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024).</li>
        <li>About 95% of rainfall occurs between October and April, leaving an extended dry season that constrains irrigation and salt flushing capacity (Bureau of Meteorology, 2025; Time and Date, n.d.).</li>
        <li>Sea levels have risen roughly 6 mm per year since the 1990s, compounding king tides and storm surge impacts on gardens, roads, and water infrastructure (Torres Strait Regional Authority, 2011; Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024).</li>
        <li>Freight windows, diesel reliance, and price mark-ups mean households routinely face grocery costs more than twice metropolitan levels, underscoring the economic value of localised production (CHOICE, 2024; Torres Cape Indigenous Council Alliance, 2023).</li>
        <li>Community leaders emphasise remaining on Country and passing on horticultural knowledge, making culturally-aligned food infrastructure an adaptation priority (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024; Torres Strait Regional Authority, n.d.).</li>
      </ul>
