          clusters tailored for Saibai (KFC Project Team, 2025).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The precinct is organised around four elevated crop zones separated by gravel access paths. Each quadrant
        contains three crop bands fed by drip irrigation lines supplied from a shared aquaponic loop. Sub-grade membrane
        liners insulate root zones from saline groundwater while allowing controlled drainage into recovery channels. A
        central operations spine houses fish tanks, filtration equipment, feed storage, and a refrigerated packing room
        to ensure uninterrupted cold chain distribution (KFC Project Team, 2025; Torres Strait Island Regional Council,
        2024).</p>
      <p>Water captured from greenhouse roofs and shade structures is stored in modular tanks before passing through a
        sediment filter, UV steriliser, and mineral dosing unit. Solar-powered pumps circulate water through fish tanks,
        biofilters, and plant beds. Overflow is returned to settlement ponds for aeration and, when necessary, is
        blended with harvested rainwater to maintain quality. A battery-backed photovoltaic system powers pumps,
        monitoring devices, and cold storage, while a diesel standby connection provides redundancy during prolonged
        cloud cover (Australian Energy Regulator, 2025; Ergon Energy, n.d.).</p>

      <h2>How the design meets TSIRC &amp; Saibai needs</h2>

      <h3>Stable, Safe &amp; Accepted Supply</h3>
      <p>Starting from weeks <strong>6-8</strong>, the system establishes a consistent weekly supply of <strong>6-10
          kg</strong> of vegetables—primarily leafy greens and herbs commonly consumed by the community—together with a
        small yet steady supplement of fish at conservative stocking densities. We maintain unit costs at
        <strong>70-85%</strong> of local retail prices for comparable products, thereby reducing overall expenses. To
        ensure food safety, on-site facilities include tool-disinfection stations and hand-washing points; seeds and
        seedlings undergo entry checks, and any anomalies plus maintenance records are posted publicly (Department of
        Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2023, 2025). Output follows a <strong>small-batch, high-frequency</strong>
        weekly rhythm aligned with household cooking and school meals, enabling planned consumption and budgeting. Three
        supporting ledgers—harvest records, price comparisons, and distribution logs—turn “stable and affordable supply”
        into a verifiable commitment (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a; Engineers Without Borders Australia,
        2025).</p>

      <h3>Resource Efficiency and Low-Cost Operation</h3>
      <p>Addressing Saibai's freshwater scarcity and high electricity costs, the system prioritizes
        <strong>rainwater-first</strong> recirculation, targeting <strong>25-40 L/kg</strong> total water intensity.
        With <strong>low-head pumps</strong>, <strong>scheduled operation</strong>, and <strong>short pipe
          runs</strong>, energy intensity is held at <strong>0.25-0.60 kWh/kg</strong> (Torres Strait Island Regional
        Council, 2025b; Ergon Energy, n.d.). We publish a monthly <em>Water Balance</em> and maintain a weekly
        <em>Electricity Log</em>, clearly showing replenishment, evaporation, recovery, and load curves to support TSIRC
        budgeting and optimization (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025b). Engineering optimization reduces base
        load so a small PV add-on can later offset most consumption; initial grid-connected operation keeps bills down
        while enabling scalable upgrades—avoiding large upfront CAPEX and balancing present feasibility with future
        improvements (Australian Energy Regulator, 2025; Ergon Energy, n.d.). Climate and evaporation assumptions
        reference nearby stations and regional datasets as boundary conditions (Bureau of Meteorology, 2025; Time and
        Date, n.d.; eAtlas, 2016/2024).</p>

      <h3>Rugged, Low-Maintenance, and Repairable</h3>
      <p>Saibai frequently faces downpours, king tides, and short outages, so the layout is raised with overflow
        recovery and splash-proof shading to handle heat and spray. Before claiming robustness, we conduct two drills: a
        <strong>48-hour blackout</strong> and a <strong>storm scenario with salinity intrusion</strong>. Acceptance
        criteria are clear—dissolved oxygen remains within safe limits, water quality recovers within <strong>24
          h</strong>, and fish mortality is zero or negligible (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024; Australian
        Energy Regulator, 2025). Routine effort is <strong>≤7 h/week</strong> (feeding, transplanting, harvesting,
        filter cleaning, logging) under concise SOPs to ensure seamless handovers. Critical components are standardized
        with on-site universal spares, targeting <strong>MTTR ≤24 h</strong> to suit an isolated-grid context and
        shipping realities (Ergon Energy, n.d.). Governance is practical: TSIRC oversight, a local operations team for
        daily tasks, and a system steward for training and data aggregation. SOPs and illustrated quick guides help
        avoid dependence on a single “expert,” consistent with local gardening practice and regional adaptation
        frameworks (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2016; Torres Strait Regional
        Authority, 2011, 2016).</p>

      <h3>Cultural Fit and Acceptance</h3>
      <p>At least <strong>70%</strong> of weekly produce comprises locally preferred leafy greens and herbs, with
        <strong>small-batch, weekly</strong> delivery minimizing storage loss and flavor degradation. Training materials
        and on-site signage use plain language with visual design and bilingual options where requested (Australian
        Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, 2016; Queensland Government, n.d.). Adoption is
        tracked via target-household coverage, user satisfaction, and recommendation-adoption rate, with
        <strong>quarterly adjustments</strong>; feedback is translated into concrete improvements so the system evolves
        with the community and gains genuine local ownership (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a; Engineers
        Without Borders Australia, 2025).</p>

      <h2>Community Concerns &amp; Responses</h2>

      <h3>Does this system produce wastewater or harm the environment?</h3>
      <p>The system operates in a closed-loop mode, so no nutrients are discharged during normal operation. Minimal
        wastewater from routine maintenance is first filtered/sedimented and preferentially reused—never discharged
        directly into the intertidal zone. Site layout and drainage follow TSIRC's coastal hazard adaptation guidance
        and regional datasets, avoiding flood-prone/erosion areas (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024; eAtlas,
        2016/2024). Any exceptional discharge event is documented, reviewed, and parameters adjusted to ensure zero
        visible impact on shoreline and wetlands (Torres Strait Regional Authority, 2011, 2016).</p>

      <h3>Is the site sufficiently spacious and safe (tides/storm surges)?</h3>
      <p>We prioritize existing hardened platforms or elevatable sites outside astronomical-tide and storm-surge
        influence. Equipment is securely anchored; overflow is routed back to storage; splash-proof shading reduces heat
        and salt-spray exposure (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2024). Final positioning and elevation are based
        on island topography, tidal curves, and historical inundation records. Where necessary, nearby station data are
        used to validate evaporation rates and shade design (eAtlas, 2016/2024; Bureau of Meteorology, 2025).</p>

      <h3>How will these claims be verified?</h3>
      <p>From day one, four KPIs are continuously updated and published: <strong>weekly output (kg)</strong>,
        <strong>water consumption (L/kg)</strong>, <strong>energy consumption (kWh and kWh/kg)</strong>, and
        <strong>household cost savings/adoption</strong>. Data are aggregated weekly/monthly, with quarterly disclosures
        on TSIRC and community boards for public trend-tracking and verification. Methods and benchmarks follow TSIRC
        reporting standards, with templates and tolerance bands aligned to community deployments to ensure long-term
        consistency (Torres Strait Island Regional Council, 2025a, 2025b; Engineers Without Borders Australia, 2025).
