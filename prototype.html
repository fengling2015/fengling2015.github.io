      <p class="flow-lead">Our system is built on the west side of the existing garden, on a highland approximately 5&nbsp;meters above sea level. We plan to select a square plot of 100&nbsp;meters by 100&nbsp;meters at this location to construct an aquaponics system, providing fresh vegetables and fish for the island. The features of our system include adaptability to climate change, environmental friendliness, sustainability, ease of maintenance, and high cost-effectiveness.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Sea lettuce is a widespread green macroalga of shallow coasts and intertidal zones that tolerates variable salinity and grows rapidly, especially in nutrient-rich waters (SeaLifeBase, n.d.). In integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and land-based recirculating systems, Ulva effectively removes dissolved nitrogen, improving effluent quality while yielding edible/feed biomass (Huo et al., 2024). For Saibai's coastal-mangrove-tidal setting, sea lettuce offers salt tolerance and "biofilter" services that fit brackish, flood-prone conditions.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>A traditional wetland staple of Pacific low atolls, giant swamp taro is cultivated in pit gardens dug down to the freshwater lens (Lyons et al., 2020) and can handle prolonged waterlogging and mildly brackish conditions (Rao et al., 2014). On very low-lying Saibai—where groundwater salinization and tidal flooding are recurrent—carefully sited, lined, or drain-managed pits can leverage this crop's flood tolerance to deliver reliable starchy yields.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Samphires are succulent halophytes that dominate saline flats and tidal margins in Australia; they show high tolerance to both salinity and waterlogging (Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development [DPIRD], 2021; The University of Western Australia [UWA], 2025). In Saibai's front-line, storm- and king-tide-affected zones, samphire can serve as an edible (young shoots) and ecological buffer species, stabilizing saline, periodically inundated ground while expanding salt-tolerant food options.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Native to Australia and New Zealand coastlines, warrigal greens is a heat-tolerant, salt-spray-tolerant leafy vegetable used as a spinach substitute—blanching is recommended due to oxalates (Australian Native Plants Society, n.d.; International Society for Horticultural Science [ISHS], 2025; Pollinator Link, 2023). Its resilience to high light, warmth and some salinity makes it a low-maintenance leafy crop for sheltered household plots on Saibai's salty, wind-exposed island environment.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>Barramundi is a euryhaline finfish native to northern Australia and the Indo-West Pacific, thriving across fresh to marine salinities and commonly inhabiting estuaries and lagoons (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO], 2017). Saibai's tropical, near-shore brackish waters are well-suited to local barramundi culture; paired with seaweeds in IMTA-style layouts, nutrient recycling can reduce discharge and improve system robustness.</p>
